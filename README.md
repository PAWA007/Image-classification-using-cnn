# Image-Classification-using-CNN
## Project Description : Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow's CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project focuses on developing an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow's CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to train a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying images into one of the ten predefined classes present in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision. It consists of 60,000 labeled color images, each with a resolution of 32x32 pixels, belonging to ten different classes, including categories such as "airplane," "car," "bird," "cat," and more.

### Key Features:

1.Dataset: The project utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, which provides a diverse collection of labeled images for training and evaluation purposes. The dataset is well-suited for developing and benchmarking image classification models.

2.Model Architecture: The image classification system employs a CNN, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing visual data. The CNN consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers that collectively extract meaningful features from images and make accurate predictions.

3.Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using stochastic gradient descent or another suitable optimization algorithm. The training process involves feeding batches of images to the model, adjusting the model's internal parameters to minimize the loss function, and evaluating the model's performance on a separate validation or test set.

4.Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the class labels of new, unseen images. Users can provide their own images or use the provided functionality to load and classify images from a directory.
